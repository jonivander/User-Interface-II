                    <p>"To see a World in a Grain of Sand
                        And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
                        Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
                        And Eternity in an hour." -William Blake.</p>
                     <p> This quote has always given me inspiratoin in my creativity. 
                        You can indeed see entire worlds in the smallest details, and with the tools provided in technologies both
                        ancient and new, we are capable of creating such wondrous things. 
                        With little to no experience, I present to you some of those Works.</p>
